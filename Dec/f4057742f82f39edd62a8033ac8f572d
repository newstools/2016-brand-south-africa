Whether you arrive in South Africa by air, sea or land, you have to pass through customs control, where you may be questioned and your baggage may be scanned or searched for dutiable, restricted or prohibited goods.On arrival, travellers with goods to declare must complete a Traveller Card and make a verbal declaration of their goods to a customs officer, who will then generate a Traveller Declaration (TRD1).If you&#8217;re found with undeclared, restricted or prohibited goods, you could be fined or even face prosecution. To help you avoid this, and make your arrival in and departure from South Africa as smooth as possible, here&#8217;s a quick guide to moving goods in and out of the country.Note: This information serves as a guide only. It remains subject to change without notice. If you are in any doubt as to whether the goods you intend to bring into South Africa are restricted, contact your nearest South African embassy or high commission abroad (see links in box on right).You can bring the following goods into South Africa without paying customs duty or value added tax (VAT):Consumable goods in accompanied baggage:People under 18 can claim this duty-free allowance on consumable goods &#8211; with the exception of alcohol and tobacco products &#8211; provided the goods are for their personal use.Medicines: You are allowed to bring in one month&#8217;s supply of pharmaceutical drugs or medicines for your personal use. Any other pharmaceutical drugs or medicines must be accompanied by a letter or certified prescription from a registered physician, and have to be declared.Personal effects, sport and recreational equipment: You can bring in personal effects, sport and recreational equipment, either as accompanied or unaccompanied baggage, for your own use during your visit.In the case of very expensive articles, you may be required to lodge a cash deposit to cover the potential duty/tax on their re-export. The deposit will be refunded on departure after a customs officer has inspected the items and verified that they are being re-exported.Handmade articles for commercial purposes: Travellers from Southern African Customs Union (SACU) or Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states are allowed to bring into South Africa handmade articles of leather, wood, plastic, or glass if the goods do not exceed 25 kilograms in total, without the payment of duties and taxes.Additional goods: In addition to the personal effects and consumables duty-free allowances, you are allowed to bring in new or used goods in accompanied baggage to the value of R5 000, or R25 000 if arriving from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia or Swaziland.Once the above limits are exceeded, all goods brought into South Africa are subject to the payment of customs duty and value added tax (VAT) &#8211; including goods bought duty-free on aircraft or ships or in duty-free shops.For goods of up to R20 000 in value, you have the option of paying customs duty at a flat rate of 20%. Flat-rated goods are also exempt from payment of VAT. This is valid only once per person per 30-day period.People under 18 can opt for the flat-rate assessment, provided the goods are for their personal use.Once you&#8217;re over the additional R20 000 limit &#8211; or if you waive the flat rate option &#8211; then duty will be assessed and paid on each individual item you&#8217;re carrying, and an additional 14% VAT will be charged.Goods that do not qualify for the flat-rate assessment include:Certain goods are restricted, and may only be brought into South Africa if you have the necessary authority or permit, and these must be declared on arrival.
